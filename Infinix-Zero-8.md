| Micro SD                  | sd card support is a bit questionable, on some roms it aint working at all,  |
|                           | on most roms exFat isnt working, formating in these roms is a bit problematic|
|                           | you have to format in a custom recovery for it to work properly,             |
|                           | formating as ext4 is probably the best bet                                   |
