Tested with system.img for A-only ARM64 devices with GApps and SU v15 (2018-04-05)

**Note:** This device was not updated to Oreo yet. So, to get Treble Project working on it, you will need following this thread : [XDA Forums](https://forum.xda-developers.com/p8lite/p8-lite-2017-discussion/guide-holy-emui8-treble-rom-pra-lx1-t3773216)

**Not Working:**

- "There's an internal problem with your device. Contact your manufacturer for details." Message after booting phone
- NFC isn't show in settings
- Auto-brightness isn't available
- Offmode charger don't work (reboot in eRecovery)
- The signal is always low (it can't reach up to 2 bars)
- Using same method as i did to install AOSP, i can't get LineageOS or RR booting

**Working:**

Everything Else.
