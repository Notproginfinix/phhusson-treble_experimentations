# Huawei P10 lite

P10 lite has many variants. I tested AICP-mordiford 180708 on WAS-LX2J.

## Hardware Support

* Camera:
> Not working except OpenCamera. Huawei stock camera on XDA doesn't work either. 

* Speaker / Microphone
> works.

* Bluetooth
> works.

* Wifi
> sometimes not working, reboot solves it.

* SIM / Mobile Data / ingoing voice calls / outgoing voice calls
> Mobile data works. SMS works. Phone call not tested.

* VoLTE
> not tested.

* Fingerprint Reader
> works. 

* 3.5mm audio jack
> sounds ugly out-of-box, just disable Bass in AudioFX and works fine.

## Additional Notes

Currently, installation can be little bit tricky.

Do NOT wipe data in TWRP. Install things with TWRP, flash stock recovery back, and wipe from stock recovery.
