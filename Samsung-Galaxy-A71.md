A71 boots only on the pe fork of phh treble  (atleast for me)
what does not work
bluetooth ear/headphones do not work workaround- ( go into phh treble settings misc features and enable force-disable a2dp offload)
If bluetooth crashes your system disable media recommendations under Sound & Vibration > Media > Show media recommendations
mtp not working (flash boot.img from twrp)
sim 1 incoming and outgoing does not work (you can revieve calls and call but you wonth hear anything nor will your mic go trying to fix) (workaround is to put your sim into slot 2) (i have heard that other people dont have this issue but some people have opposite issue )
if the phone dies it wont boot to get back hold down power button and volume down
