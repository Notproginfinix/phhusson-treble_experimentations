## Additional Notes

> At the end of the setup process, you'll be asked to "Continue setting up your Pixel," however the system settings will correctly report that you've got a BND-L34.

> Brightness slider does nothing.  You can slide it up or down, but the screen brightness will not change.  System settings report it's stuck at 73%.

> By and large, the GSI works.  However lack of HD calling (VoLTE) and spotty wifi issues could be deal-breakers for some.

> The Mate SE is essentially a Honor 7x with 3GB of RAM and 64GB of storage.  Behavior of this ROM on either device is generally expected to be the same.
