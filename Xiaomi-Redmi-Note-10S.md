# Personal Notes:
- Battery life seems to have reduced a bit
- Phone (extremely rarely) reboots out of nowhere.
- Raven Launcher (Launcher that comes with Corvus OS) crashes from time to time, taking me back to the lock screen
- I personally feel that the speakers are not as loud as they **could be** but I did not test it before flash so I can't tell precisely.
