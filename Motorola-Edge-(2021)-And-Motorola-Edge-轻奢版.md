First,Please allow me to show you those URLs.   
[Motorola Edge (2021) detail in US Official Website]( https://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones-motorola-edge-gen-2/p?skuId=631)  
[Motorola Edge 轻奢版 detail in CN Official Website](https://item.lenovo.com.cn/product/1017004.html)  
By comparing the official website details of two mobile phones with different names, I think the two mobile phones are the **same model**.Just because of different regions and different names.Their parameters look similar. However, from the perspective of parameters, **the screen materials may be slightly different**. And the color of the phone.So I think if someone happens to have any of these versions, maybe they can contribute to testing GSI.
