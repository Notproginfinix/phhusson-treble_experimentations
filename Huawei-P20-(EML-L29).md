* "Cast mode" is broken as well
* Theme is not working. (Display>Advanced Parameters>Device theme)
* Apps are crashing sometimes if you start using them too early. 
* If fresh flash, you need to remove all data and clear cache before downloading apps from PlayStore
* DONT RESTORE BACKUPS, START FRESH or a lot of things will be broken.
