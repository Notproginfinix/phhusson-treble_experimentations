## Additional Notes

The Nokia 7 released in China does have both IMEI and MEID, but the rom won't recognize MEID, which isn't a big problem.
I really don't recommend you to use this as daily driver unless you don't use it for telephone calls. 

In fact the boot kernel of [[Nokia 6 (2018)]], [[Nokia 7]], [[Nokia 7 Plus]] and [[Sharp Aquos S2]] are identical.

To non-Nokia users: The stock camera can be installed on non-Nokia phones, but you can't get Pro Camera interface.
