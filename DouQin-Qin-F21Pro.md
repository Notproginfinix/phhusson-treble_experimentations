# DouQin Qin F21Pro

This device is unique, as it is with a traditional physical T9 keyboard (like old Nokias).
Because this, you need to copy /system/usr/keylayout folder from a stock ROM into your GSI ROM.
Works with all firmware versions, but from my experience best with [1.1.1](https://fm.mitm.top/index.php/s/MdDnY6f5s2M2tiE).

## Steps to install

* Unpack super.img
* Replace system_a.img with GSI img.
* Repack super.img
* Flash new super.img with SP flsh tool.
(Maybe you can also flash through a pastbot like on other devices, I haven't tried).
