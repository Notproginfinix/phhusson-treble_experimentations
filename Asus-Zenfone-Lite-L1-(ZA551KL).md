### AOSP 9.0 v111 works flawlessly on Asus Zenfone Lite L1
* All sensors are working
* Battery backup same as stock ROM
* For better RAM management, use NFS Injector Magisk module
* Default camera app is dark. Use any 3rd party camera like Footej, Open Camera or Bacon Camera to fix it
* UI is faster than stock ZenUI
* Magisk Root is working (SafetyNet check is passed!)
* EdXposed For Pie is working
* VoLTE is working

### NOTES!
VoLTE is working stable and good. All you need to do is to install ims.apk and flash VoLTE patch, after reboot you will see a HD icon on status bar and a **DEVICE IS HD CAPABLE** notification (it takes 3-4 minutes to activate VoLTE automatically). And don't forget after reboot, make sure to be on 4G(LTE) only mode or set it by dialing *#*#4636#*#* in the dialer. [Download VoLTE patch here!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16npOIg8xeXv4kAZaHw6eDNeRwfBF4fTD)

### The Bugs
Well there are no major bugs, the GSI works pretty much stable on this device, the few minor bugs i noticed are
1. Last full charge stats in battery section in setting resets everytime you reboot, so it is inaccurate.
2. Sometimes The battery icon in status bar won't show the charging animation when you plug your phone to charge (though the phone charges normally).
3. Disabling battery optimization for apps resets back to previous state after reboot.
