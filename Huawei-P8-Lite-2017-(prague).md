# NOTES
* There is a device compostition workaround by enabling "Blurry UI workaround" from Treble app in Huawei features in menu section
* Offline charging is working but at the moment you can see just a black screen while charging. To fix this use this manual fix: https://forum.xda-developers.com/project-treble/trebleenabled-device-development/huawei-offline-charge-fix-huawei-treble-t3817944 Credits to Dil3mm4

* For additional fixes and improvements look at this [Xda Thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/gsi-pie-and-quack-manual-fixes-for-hi6250-devices.3936745/)
AIO fixes for Android 10 and 11 are recommended to have everything fully working.
