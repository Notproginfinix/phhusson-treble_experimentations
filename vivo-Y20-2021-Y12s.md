## How to flash GSI

You need:
- Unlocked bootloader
- TWRP must be already installed
- A PC and platform-tools

First you may need to download GSI which suite our phone
 'arm64 AB'

Steps:
1. Reboot your phone to fastboot mode (bootloader) using adb command `adb reboot bootloader` or hold volume up key when rebooting
2. Type `fastboot -w` <- this will erase userdata
3. Now type `fastboot reboot fastboot` <- this will reboot to fastbootd which allow us to flash system image on dynamic partition
4. To flash system image, type `fastboot flash system [The path where the gsi.img file is located or drag gsi.img file]` and wait for it
5. Once it finishes flashing, you can reboot using TWRP or vivo recovery or command `fastboot reboot`

Congrats, you have GSI installed on your phone!
