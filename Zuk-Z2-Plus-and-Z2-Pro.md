## Additional Notes

We don't have Treble out of the box, it has been enabled by Zuk-devs (Cosmedd, Davidevinavil and DD3Boh)
We are using /factory partition which is around 382mb in our Zuk Z2 as our /vendor partition.

**F.A.Q**

Q: How to get Treble support in Z2 Plus / Z2 Pro?

A: To get **Treble support**, you'll need to flash a latest **ROM which has vendor image** compiled with the latest changes done in sources by ZUK-devs, once you flash such a ROM, you'll get the **vendor stuff stored in the vendor partition**, and after that you can **flash any GSI** on your phone!


Q: Your device doesn't have **/factory** partition?

A: Flash **ZUI 3.5 Oreo** and after that **unlock bootloader** and **flash a TWRP flashable Treble ROM**
