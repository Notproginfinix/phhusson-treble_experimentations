Since tiffany has separate vendor partition by default, nothing special to do with it.

GSI v105 was tested with  following prerequisites:
* Xiaomi Mi A1 (tissot) firmware installed
* GSI was installed over AOSP Extended 5.8 (Android 8.1) which provides Treble support on it's own.

Following issues found:
* Bluetooth not working
* WiFi hotspot
* Automatic brightness missing as an option
* Camera's features like slow motion video and HDR(doesn't look like HDR), photo and video capturing are working. Third-party cameras were tested only with gapps installed(both cameras tested did not work without gapps).

Not tested:
* VoLTE
* using two SIM cards
* microSD


Other than that everything else looks like working, including IR transmitter.
