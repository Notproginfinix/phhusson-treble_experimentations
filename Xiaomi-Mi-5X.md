Since tiffany has separate vendor partition by default, nothing special to do with it.

GSI v105 was tested with  following prerequisites:
* Xiaomi Mi A1 (tissot) firmware installed
* GSI was installed over AOSP Extended 5.8 (Android 8.1) which provides Treble support on it's own.

Following issues found:
* Bluetooth not working
* Automatic brightness missing as an option
* Camera's features like slow motion video and HDR, was tested with camera app from other ROM. Photo and video capturing are working.

Not tested:
* VoLTE

Other than that everything else looks like working, including IR transmitter, SD card, using both SIM cards.
