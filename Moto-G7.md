# Device

I was stuck during the Google services initial setup.
Sometimes I get a popup which says that the app "Settings" keeps stopping.
I suspect this is because neither Wifi, neither 4G is working.



## Steps to install

* Step 1 : fastboot flash system_b system-squeak-arm64-ab-gapps.img
* Step 2 : Reboot
