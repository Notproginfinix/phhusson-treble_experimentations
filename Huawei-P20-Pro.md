Boots with EMUI 9 vendor (P & Q), need to factory reset in stock recovery after flashing GSI, otherwise it does not boot.

* Stock AOSP camera works, GCam port works a bit.
* Adaptive brightness works, but minimum brightness a bit too high to my liking.
* Fingerprint sensor seems to work, but can not enroll fingerprint (same on all non-native ROMs for this devices). Also the fingerprint navigation does not work (not able to disable the navbar).
