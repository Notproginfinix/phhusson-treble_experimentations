# Huawei Mate 20 Pro (UD) (LYA-AL10)

Installation instructions and tests

## Steps to install
###  Downgrade to EMUI 9.x and unlock the bootloader
(Software test points using DC-Phoneix and HCU clients etc...)  If you managed to get an unlock code back in 2019, that's worth a try too.
If you downgrade a device from EMUI 11 or above, you will need a harmony tp cable to reenable USB **2.0** transfer. Regular USB **3.0** cable might be OK (not tested).

If downgrading from EMUI 11,  Huawei SCP fast charging cannot be activated.

### Flash the image
`adb reboot bootloader`

`fastboot flash system Havoc-OS-v3.12-20201230-Official-arm64-ab.img`

Don't forget to do a factory reset in the stock recovery.

*If you downgrade to EMUI 9 and can use usb transfer before flashing the system image, you can still use it after flashing. If you can't before, you can't laterã€‚

**Copy the /data/misc/adb/ folder from another Android device that is authorized for debugging to this Android device that needs to be debugged, and then reboot.(recommended)  or  `setprop ro.adb.secure 0` (not recommended as it allows debugging from any computer and is not safe).
