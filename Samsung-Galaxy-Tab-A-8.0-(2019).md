# Hardware support:

| Component                 |      Comment                                              |

| Camera                    | Working. (Front & back cameras tested)                                                   |
| Speaker/Mic               | Working.                                                   |
| Bluetooth                 | Bluetooth audio works. Bluetooth file transfer is untested.                                                  |
| WiFi                      | Working.                                                   |

| Display size              | You will have to set the screen size to 600dp in the developer options in the device settings.                                                   |
| Display mode              | On first boot, the display shows in portrait mode. You'll have to fix this by allowing screen rotation in the display section of the device settings.                                                      |
| Battery                   | Battery life seems a lot better than the stock firmware.
