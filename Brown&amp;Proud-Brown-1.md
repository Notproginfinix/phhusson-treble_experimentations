# Brown&Proud Brown 1 (V4701_I01)

Let's get straight to the point, GSI ROMs are eligible for daily usage, the main issue is hardware heating. It is due, the manufacturer did not provide enough sources for us to publish a newer and more stable build of Wolf Custom Kernel by @LionSinOfPride.

What is Wolf Kernel?

• Wolf Kernel is a custom kernel project, developed by @LionSinOfPride and tested by Черная мамба on his Brown 1 clone, Ovvi SK3. The aim of the kernel is to give you the privilege of tasting the sweetness of Android Oreo and above without making a switch or swap. However, the result succeeded but there's no way to flash it in an easy way. In order to flash the kernel, you'll be required to use Ubuntu 16.04 (x64) on your PC. 

The kernel is still WIP so as always, do it at your own risk.

## Steps to install
