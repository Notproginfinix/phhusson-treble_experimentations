### Your warranty is now void. I am not responsible for bricked devices, dead SD cards, thermonuclear war, or you getting fired because the alarm app failed. Please do some research if you have any concerns about features included in this ROM before flashing it! YOU are choosing to make these modifications, and if you point the finger at me for messing up your device, I will laugh at you.

### Bluetooth workarounds (fixes no audio in bluetooth headset):
Open settings -> Phh treble settings -> Misc features -> Bluetooth workarounds -> select mediatek
Open settings -> Phh treble settings -> Misc features -> Use System wide bt hal

### No AOD:
Open settings -> Phh treble settings -> Misc features -> Force always on display (note: AOD for some reason never updates unless you get a notification, no workaround yet.)
