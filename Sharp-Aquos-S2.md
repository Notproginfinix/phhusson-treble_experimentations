## Additional Notes

> Since Android 8.1 isn't released on SHARP Aquos S2 when I'm testing, you must use boot kernel from Nokia 7 or 7+ in order to make the phone boot, if you want to test builds based on Android 8.1.
But an error will prompt:

There's an internal problem with your device. Contact your manufacturer for details.

> The OS doesn't display properly due to it's screen like Essentials PH-1.
