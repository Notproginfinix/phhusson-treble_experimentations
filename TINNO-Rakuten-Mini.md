# The world's smallest Snapdragon-powered Treble-enabled phone

## Before installation
Rakuten Mini is released with Android 9 but vendor implementation is broken and you have to install [this Magisk Module](https://github.com/AndroPlus-org/magisk-module-c330-gsi/releases) or [modded vendor image](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_YDpV9-Wbbbvdjd2eGF1ofSGorc8xaq9/view?usp=sharing). Otherwise the phone will bootloop at home screen.
