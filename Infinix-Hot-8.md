## **Steps to install**

* **1. Unlock Bootloader**

  `fastboot oem unlock` or `fastboot flashing unlock`

* **2. Flash TWRP 3.3.1**

 Download TWRP 3.3.1 from [here](https://androidfilehost.com/?fid=4349826312261627248) made by Jackson Makinda

 Follow instructions in README.txt for flashing instruction and disabling encryption to access internal storage in TWRP

* **3. Flash vbmeta with disable verity**

 You must disable verified boot for this device to boot custom firmware or else you'll be stuck in a boot loop

 You must do this with vbmeta because magisk preserves dm-verity for system-as-root devices so you cant use magisk to disable it

 You can download vbmeta from [here](http://www.mediafire.com/file/bphav495l85wr0q/vbmeta.img/file)

 Then flash the file through fastboot by;

 ``
 $ fastboot --disable-verity --disable-verification flash vbmeta vbmeta.img
 ``

* **4. Flash a arm32binder64 A/B (A64 A/B) image with the `fastboot` utility:**

   For example;

    ```
    $ fastboot flash system system-arm32binder64-ab-gapps-su.img
    ```

* **5. As an alternative you can flash via TWRP as "System Image" and format data.**
