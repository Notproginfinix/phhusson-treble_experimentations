# üì± Realme 8 Pro - RMX3081

**System-as-root | Full VNDK | ARM64**

Most basic features work perfectly, but some hardware/software components are broken. Most minor issues can be automatically fixed by connecting to the internet and doing: 

* Treble Settings ‚Üí My Device ‚Üí Apply Presets.
* Treble Settings ‚Üí IMS ‚Üí Install APK for Qualcomm Vendor.
* Reboot.

RMX3081 comes with the 4.14 kernel version, so don't expect most initial A14 QPR2 releases to boot.

## üìÉ Steps to install

**Back up `super` before proceeding!**

Flash your image with the `fastboot` utility from `platform-tools`:

```
fastboot flash system system-arm64-ab.img
```

Do NOT wipe data through TWRP, PBRP or OrangeFox, use `fastboot -w` instead. If the ROM is too large to install, you can delete some `my_*` partitions to free more space. Do note, that deleting some partitions can lead to a boot loop. Unlike other devices, the `product` partition on the 8 Pro is tiny (12MB), so it's not worth removing it.

```
fastboot delete-logical-partition my_preload
```
