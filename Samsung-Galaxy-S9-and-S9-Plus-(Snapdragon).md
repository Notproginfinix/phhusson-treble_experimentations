An earlier version of this page states that:
>Everything work except brightness that is always at max and fingerprint and lockscreen that cant bee set, if try to set any tipe of lock systemui will crash after reboot

[G960U] However, when using AOSP 9.0 v123, there appears to be no problems when controlling the brightness of the screen. Biometrics will not work, but setting up a PIN will work just fine. The headphone jack **does not** appear to work; the internal speakers will be used whether something is plugged in the jack or not.

[G960U] As of AOSP 9.0 v123 and AOSP 10.0 v213, wireless data is not working for Spectrum Wireless. Wireless settings shows only an APN for Verizon (VZWINTERNET). Tapping "Mobile plan" shows the message "Verizon has no known provisioning website". FYI: Spectrum is an MVNO that uses Verizon's towers.

[G960U] On AOSP 9.0 v123, Inserting a Sprint SIM card in the phone results in the software going haywire. The cell status would change rapidly from normal to Roaming. One could probably make a call if they were fast enough, but the Modem firmware kept crashing, resulting in the entire OS to halt abruptly.

[G960U] As of AOSP 10.0 v219, Wi-Fi does not work at all.
