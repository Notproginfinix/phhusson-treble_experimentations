In my testing aosp phh does not boot but pe based on phh boots (it should be possible to fix but im not going to go try it)
BUGS-:
fake corners that cut the screen 
mtp not working on a307fn (use twrp for mtp as a workaround)
headphone jack does not work (installing pixel feature drop will fix it or enabling use different headphone detection in phh settings)
if battery dies to get it back on you need to hold down power and volume down
