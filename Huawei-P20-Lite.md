- Sometimes we get "Corrupted SD card", DO NOT FORMAT, just reboot or else reinstall it and it's fine ;). 
- Camera, sometimes the app is missing after flashing. -  The 2 times i installed I didn't had problems if so please report to me on my xda link ^^.
- Status Icons can be cropped indeed specially on the knotch :(.
- Status bar not adjusted with the notch. (Status bar is cropped a bit on the edges)
- Problems with bluetooth, it is not stable, specially with audio(headphones and others). As the same issue as it has on the official ROM on version ANE-LX1 8.0.0.125(C432) SS and ANE-LX1 8.0.0.126(C432) DS.
- Play Store randomly fails to download apps.
