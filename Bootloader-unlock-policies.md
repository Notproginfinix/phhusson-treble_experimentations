## Xiaomi Global 1.5/5

Xiaomi's unlock policy is pretty annoying. You'll always be able to unlock your bootloader, but you can't know ahead of time how much time it will take. It can be anything between 3 days and 2 months.

Also it requires a Windows-only PC tool. You'll need to run the Windows-only PC tool at least twice: Once to mark the date of the start of the unlock, and the other one to make the actual unlock.

It is possible that the wait-time changes during the wait itself.

The service is however pretty reliable.

## Asus 4/5

On Asus devices, you just need to find the developer app (it is specific to the device), install it on your device, launch it, and you'll be able to unlock your device.

However, the developer app isn't usually available day one, and the service isn't totally reliable.
