# Samsung Galaxy S10e 

I've been driving Andre Yang's lineageOS for about 4 months, and had no major trouble, autobrightness doesn't work, neither does mtp, but everything else seems to work just fine.

## Steps to install

* No twrp:  Follow [this guide](https://forum.xda-developers.com/galaxy-s10/how-to/guide-how-to-install-custom-rom-using-t4114435) made by user kkoo on xda.
* TWRP: Flash gsi img file as system in twrp.
