## Ovvi SK3 (V4701_I01) <br> <img src="https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1GKZiarwrBKNjSZPcq6xpapXaq/ovvi-SK3-V4701-Fingerprint-Mobile-Phone-4G-4-7-inch-HD-1280-720P-2GB-RAM-16GB.jpg" alt="drawing" width="200"/>

Let's get straight to the point, GSI ROMs for this device are eligible for daily usage, the main issue is hardware heating. It is due, the manufacturer did not provide enough sources for us to publish a newer and more stable build of Wolf Custom Kernel by @LionSinOfPride.

What is Wolf Kernel?

• Wolf Kernel is a custom kernel project, developed by @LionSinOfPride and tested by Черная мамба on Ovvi SK3. Apparently, it is confirmed working on its clone or rebrand in Philippines, "Brown&Proud Brown 1" by @androidist1204. 
The aim of the kernel is to give you the privilege of tasting the sweetness of Android Oreo and above without making a switch or swap. However, the result is positive but there's no way to flash it in an easy way. 
So, in order to flash the kernel, you will be required to use Ubuntu 16.04 (x64) on your PC.

The kernel is still a WIP (Work-In-Progress) so as always, proceed at your own risk.

Steps to install
Sorry for your inconvenience, but we will make sure to keep this page up-to-date as soon as possible. Keep tuned for more updates.
