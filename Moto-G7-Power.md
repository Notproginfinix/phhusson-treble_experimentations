# Motorola Moto G7 Power (XT-1955) (ocean)


## Wireless

### Wi-Fi

works

### Mobile data

currently not working - seems to work on unlocked models, but not carrier-locked models, like Metro by T-Mobile. Plus, on unlocked models, mobile data disconnects when a call is ongoing

### Bluetooth

currently not working - a file on the device's vendor that the GSI requires is not available, preventing Bluetooth media audio from working. Bluetooth calls, on the other hand, works fine


## RIL

### Calling

- Start call

works

- Receive call

works

### VoLTE

currently not working - [the apk](https://t.me/R3SPX_UPDATES/459) and [the patch](https://t.me/R3SPX_UPDATES/458) provided via [the #phh-volte Telegram group](https://t.me/phhvolte) works, but prevents calls from hanging up successfully

### Messaging

- Sending (SMS and MMS)
