Device
It booted fine, WiFi and hotspot doesn't work, testing fix soon. Every other thing works fine, camera is a bit dark but third party camera should fix it, no auto brightness overlay is needed to fix that, I don't really know how to compile one but I'll work on it.
The ROM is smooth and good as daily driver. (As far as WiFi and hotspot is fixed.)
