It seems most of the Gsi roms can run pretty well.
And it seems that the miui of China version cant be the base,personally tried with the eu version and it works well.
Firstly,please ensure that you shouldnt run your phone with China version miui,eu version can be good. And you should ensure that you know something about the fastboot,recovery and magisk. The 3.2.3 version of unofficial TWRP can be used.
Then,please download the gsi(PE Arrow and so on).img, FBE_Disabler.zip and magisk17.1.zip(if boot filed please flash it,download link can be found below).
And,reboot to recovery and wipe data,reboot to recovery again,mount all partions,flash FBE_Disabler.zip,finally,just flash the Gsi img,then reboot to system.
