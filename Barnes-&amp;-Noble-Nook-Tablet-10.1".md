# Hardware Support
* Buttons: Work.
* Camera: Stock camera works, front and back.
* Speakers: Work.
* Bluetooth: Bluetooth Audio works. File transfer untested.
* WiFi: Works.
* Display: Works, though screen size is retrieved incorrectly? Reports as a 14.1" display, so the DPI is off. Can be worked around with "Easy DPI Changer".

## Additional Notes:
* Boot animation is missing on Phh-treble v25, unsure why.
* Does not boot Phh-treble v107, seems to have errors with the GPU and KeyMaster.
