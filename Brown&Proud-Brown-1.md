Brown&Proud Brown 1 GSI Page

What is Brown 1?
Currently, Brown 1 is a local-branded device made by Brown&Proud, a sister company if MyPhone in Philippines, which runs on stock Android 7.0, Nougat. Developer @LionSinOfPride made the device possible to boot GSI/Treble ROMs, thanks to his Wolf Custom Kernel project, the users of this device are now eligible to experience the sweetness of Android Oreo and above.
However, even though the manufacturer did not provide enough sources for us to publish a more stable version of our kernel, we still have no intention of letting the project get outdated.
