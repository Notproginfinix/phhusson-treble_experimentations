Volte is working stable and good 
All you need to do is to install ims apk and flash volte patch , after restart you will se an HD icon on status bar and a DEVICE IS HD CAPABLE notiification  (it takes 3-4 minutes to activate volte automatically ) after restarts , make sure to be on 4G(LTE) only mode or set it by dialing *#*#4636#*#* in the dialer.

## ****## The Bugs ****

well there are no major Bugs the gsi works pretty much stable on this device , the few minor bugs i noticed are. 
1.LAST FULL CHARGE STAT in Battery section in setting resets everytime you reboot , so it is inaccurate.

2.sometimes The battery icon in status bar  dont show the charging animation , when you plug your phone to charge (Though the phone charges normally ).

3.Disabling battery optimization for apps resets back to previous state after reboot. 

Thats all i encountered till now.
