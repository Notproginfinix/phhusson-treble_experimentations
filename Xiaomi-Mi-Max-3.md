## Music does not play via Bluetooth
Instead, it is played through the phone speakers even when connected to a bluetooth device.

No known solution

## GPS is slow to start
Workaround: Install [GPS Test](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chartcross.gpstest&hl=en_US&gl=US) and reset AGPS database. Then launch it a couple of times outdoors and let it connect 4+ satellites. That should restore AGPS to normal function.
