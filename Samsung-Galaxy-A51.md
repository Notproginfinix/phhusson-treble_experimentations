## Steps to install

* Step 1: Download & Install TWRP [this guide](https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/installing-twrp-and-root-for-samsung-galaxy-a51-with-video.4212205/) if the TWRP provided boot loops after flashing GSI, try [this updated version](https://t.me/dev_yilliee/145)
* Step 2: Download dynapatch [here](https://t.me/dev_yilliee/125), disable-dm-verity [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mZeg-ZgrUGqWo_Y0Q2nNcINx-WURBTGg/view?usp=sharing), and a GSI from [probably here](https://github.com/phhusson/treble_experimentations/wiki/Generic-System-Image-%28GSI%29-list)
* Step 3: Flash dynapatch in twrp to map super partitions and reboot recovery, flash dm-verity-disabler, then flash the gsi image as "system image" 
* Step 4: Reboot System, enjoy.

Note: The availability of other camera sensors ( Macro, Wide-Angle and Depth sensor ) depends on the camera app you're using. You can access the extra sensors using a camera app that supports multiple sensors ( for example open camera ).
