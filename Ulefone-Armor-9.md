# Ulefone Armor 9
The device generally works fine. The thermal camera and endoscope apps can be incorporated into any GSI with https://github.com/phhusson/ulefone-armor-9-gsi


So far the thermal camera works in Android12 GSIs if you set SElinux to permissive once (it's only needed once for some reason) with `setenforce 0` as root. I haven't managed to get it working on Android 13 though.
