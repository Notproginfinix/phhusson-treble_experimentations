## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known issues and solutions
- **First of all open phh treble settings and examine each option. If properly configured, it solves 90% of all bugs.**
- Camera sometimes throws fatal error and OpenCamera apk hangs. Just close it and reopen.
- Speaker requires calibration for stereo playback. I'm using Precise Volume apk and it solves the issue.
- Speaker is sometimes too loud during phone call and it's impossible to turn down the volume. Reboot solves the issue.
- Mobile Data hangs on 3G despite of 4G and 5G availability. Enable airplane mode and turn it off after few seconds.
- Bluetooth crashes while connecting to the speaker. It's vendor issue - just flash latest HyperOS.
- Video hangs (in NewPipe apk for example). It's another vendor issue - fix same as above.
- GUI crashes to lock screen. Just enter your pin again or unlock using fingerprint sensor.
