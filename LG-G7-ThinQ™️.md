# Hardware
Has been tested on:
- LMG710EM (the only phone variant that is unlockable at the moment)

# GSI tested
[phh](https://forum.xda-developers.com/project-treble/trebleenabled-device-development/experimental-phh-treble-t3709659) works with vendor and boot image from firmware revision 10b OOTB (and with a modified kernel on 10p vendor+boot image aswell)

# Notes
[J0SH1X](https://www.github.com/J0SH1X) has mostly fixed the (horribly) messed up kernel sources released by LG of version 10p on his github page. Some things may be non-working yet though.
The file /system/system/etc/selinux/plat_sepolicy.cil needs to be modified: TBD
