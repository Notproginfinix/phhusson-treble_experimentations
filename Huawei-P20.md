# [Huawei P20] - [EML-L29]

**### What's not working**

* Google stock camera app is laggy (haven't tried phhusson's port yet)
* Fingerprint sensor (not detected in setup and cannot finish configuration in the device settings)
* "Cast mode" is broken as well
* Theme is not working. (Display>Advanced Parameters>Device theme)
* Apps are crashing sometimes if you start using them too early. 
* If fresh flash, you need to remove all data and clear cache before downloading apps from PlayStore
* DONT RESTORE BACKUPS, START FRESH or a lot of things will be broken.

### What's working

Stock EMUI camera port available!  -> https://forum.xda-developers.com/huawei-p20-pro/development/huawei-p20-pro-camera-gallery-treble-t3805011

Everything else seems to be working.
