>The phone runs cooler than stock ROM and also is cooler during fast charging. Battery is better than the stock ROM. Performance is sufficient for a user's daily needs(Social Media, Light gaming and calls) although there are lags when the device is pushed.

>Google Assistant is not available in this ROM even after installing both the Google App and Google Assistant .apk files from Google Play. Says device not supported.

>I had to change the network signal reading method RSRP to get accurate signal reading. Leaving it on default mode shows no signal while the other two shows full-signal always.
