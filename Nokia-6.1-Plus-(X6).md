>The phone runs cooler than stock ROM and also is cooler during fast charging. Battery is better than the stock ROM. Performance is sufficient for a user's daily needs(Social Media, Light gaming and calls) although there are lags when the device is pushed.

>Move the Google app to /root/system-priv/ directory to enable Google Assistant

>Viper4Android(I used the magisk module, Material Edition) needs the option **Attach Audio Effects** to process sound effects properly.

>System does not reset battery stats automatically after the phone charge 80> or more. You will have to do it manually.

>Magisk's safetynet manager will report ```Basic Intergrity:True``` and ```CTS:False```. You can use the MagiskHideProps module to pass the CTS test. Enable advanced hiding and change the fingerprint to Nokia 7 plus's(B2N). (Theoretically you can use any Fingerprint but i've never tested any other than Nokia 7 plus's.
