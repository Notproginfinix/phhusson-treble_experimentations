## Support
Latest builds of both TrebleBuilds (17th March) and Project Elixir (23rd Feb) did not boot successfully; all of them bootlooped. As of 29th of June, CRdroid and Pixel Experience work, with TWRP and Magisk installed (required to boot properly)
1. A/B partioning is supported and the treble info app reports to download an ab partitioned device, but seamless updates are not available.
