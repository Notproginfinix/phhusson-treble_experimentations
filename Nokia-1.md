Network modem: Kinda works. 2G works (No Internet connection, failed to catch PDP). 3G and 4G fails the Modem software. Cause the Phone didn't recognize the SIM, restart the phone will fix this.

Please force the Phone works into 2G networking only if you still want the phone can have calling and texting functions.

You cannot change any network band in test settings

Can't change network band on *#*#4636#*#*.

(All mentioned are not tested on 2nd SIM slot or along side with 1st SIM slot)

Bluetooth works poorly.

Wi-Fi works fine.

Wi-Fi Hotspot didn't work on Bluetooth mode.

On files app. When showing Internal storage cause the app force stop once or many times.

Google Play services crashes a lot.

Camera works, but bad (additonal lighting) because it's uses Camera2 API to make the camera works. But it's bad.

This is an Android Go phone too. So any feature that Android Go optimizes will go along with stock ROM.

Not acting like Full Android ROM whatsoever.
