    Some more info

    Like all Xiaomi's devices, it takes one week to unlock the bootloader.

    If you have some bugs (quick settings broken, user /data files) with Android 10, first install AOSP 9.0 (v121 recommended), configure your Google account and install latest AOSP 10.0 (only wipe system needed for update).
