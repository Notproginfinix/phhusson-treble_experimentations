# Device

Seems to work fine with many AOSP builds 12, 13, 14 image, vanilla and gapps!

Occasionally a reboot will go silly and just not want to work right; in that case, another reboot usually fixes it.

## Steps to install

* You need to flash a Custom recovery (TWRP or OFRP)
* Follow the instructions [TWRP](https://t.me/samsung_a137f/5) [OFRP](https://t.me/samsung_a137f/8).
* Boot into TWRP, select wipe > Formate data > type yes > back > Advanced Wipe > select Dalvik / ART Cache and Data > swipe the buttom slider.
* return back to home > install > Select Storage > Micro SD > Ok > Install Image > choose the gsi img not xz > choose system image > Swipe to flash > reboot > and enjoy!

Most of featuers works instead of:
* No Auto Brightness.
* IDK if VoLTE works?
* Promixy sensor (if screen goes black you need to wake up the phone.
* Camera Quality not the best i think.
