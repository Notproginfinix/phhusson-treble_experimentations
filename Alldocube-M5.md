Only from AOSP 8.1 [2018-08-16] Phh-Treble (v23). Earlier builds unusable due to touchscreen not working issue. Other ROMs also unusable for this reason until updated with the v23 base changes. Recent v25 build seems to perform a little better.

For Android 9.0, only _[AOSP 9.0] [EXPERIMENTAL] [2018-09-19] Phh-Treble_ or later (expected), and ROMS based on this. Earlier based builds also have the touchscreen issue. 

ROM used: _system.img for A-only ARM64 devices with GApps and SU_

No special flash settings for the GSI are required. Process is as generically stated on XDA pages. The display scaling is much smaller than OEM ROM, but when set to largest it is the ideal size.

Tested using the latest ROM from Alldocube, it needs to be fully flashed. They fixed a few minor bugs so highly recommended. 

ROM can be downloaded here, course the latest M5 version. This ROM includes Google Store etc.

This will wipe all data, but is a good start for the ROM as it's probably beneficial to factory reset the v23 or later/other GSI.
