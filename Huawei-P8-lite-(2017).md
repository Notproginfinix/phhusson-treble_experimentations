Tested with system.img for A-only ARM64 devices with GApps (2018-05-29)

**Note:** These devices were not updated to Oreo yet. 
So, to get Treble Project working on it, you will need following [this thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/p8lite/p8-lite-2017-discussion/guide-holy-emui8-treble-rom-pra-lx1-t3773216) and [this thread](https://forum.xda-developers.com/p8lite/p8-lite-2017-development/aio-prepare-device-knowledge-gsi-t3812024)

- "There's an internal problem with your device. Contact your manufacturer for details." Message after booting phone (this is should be related)[Not faced on Honor 6x]
