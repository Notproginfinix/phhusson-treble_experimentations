It's best to include as many components as you can, especially device-specific features like flip-cameras, fans, folding, etc. 

Common components may include: Camera, SIM / Mobile Data / Voice, Speaker / Mic, Bluetooth, NFC, VoLTE, Auxiliary Cameras, Wi-Fi, Sensors.

People are not interested in what works, so put what doesn't work first.
